# Hotel-Reservation
This project, titled "Hotel Reservation," is a lab exercise for the "Software Engineering and DevOps" course at SoftUni. The project involves four students playing different roles (Questioner, Offerer, Admin, Verifier) who collaborate using GitHub branches to work on a simple web front-end project.

The project aims to create a reservation system for a family hotel. It starts with an unfinished web interface that already has some implemented functionalities (such as a "Thank you" page) and requires the implementation of additional functionalities (such as Search Form, Search Result Form, Guest Details Form, Confirm Reservation Form).

The project is organized into team assignments, where each team member assumes a specific role and implements a particular functionality:

1. Questioner: Implements the "Search Form" functionality, which allows users to provide and manage offers through a form for date and number of people.
2. Offerer: Implements the "Our Offers Form" functionality, enabling the Offerer to provide and manage offers through a dedicated form.
3. Admin: Implements the "Guest Details Form" functionality, which involves gathering and managing guest information through a dedicated form.
4. Verifier: Implements the "Confirm Reservation Form" functionality, allowing the Verifier to confirm reservations through a dedicated form.

The project progression involves the following steps for each team member:

1. Create and clone the GitHub repository for the "Hotel Reservation" project.
2. Invite other team members as collaborators in the repository.
3. Clone the project to a local folder.
4. Implement the assigned functionality by making changes to the source code files (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) locally.
5. Test the functionality to ensure it works correctly.
6. Commit the changes to the local branch.
7. Push the committed changes to GitHub, creating a remote branch.
8. Create a pull request from the feature branch to the main branch.
9. Resolve any conflicts and merge the pull request.
10. Repeat steps 4-9 for each team member's functionality.
11. Delete the feature branches after merging and approving all pull requests.

The project follows a collaborative workflow using Git branches and pull requests to manage code changes and ensure proper integration of the implemented functionalities.
